The previous AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive IMWG Risk Prediction Calculator and R-ISS staging tool for multiple myeloma, progressing from initial requirements to a feature-complete application ready for deployment. The development followed a structured approach: initial frontend mock-up, iterative design refinements based on user feedback, backend integration with MongoDB and FastAPI, and thorough backend testing. Key challenges involved accurately implementing complex medical criteria, correctly interpreting user design feedback on visualizations, and incorporating specific content from provided manuscript images while avoiding self-generated data. The AI engineer also provided detailed deployment guidance for free and low-cost options and began assisting with GitHub integration. The work demonstrates strong technical execution, adaptability, and adherence to user-specific content requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a calculator for IMWG Risk prediction for multiple myeloma, based on a new research paper. The application should be intuitive, informative, simple, elegant, and usable on both mobile and desktop, similar to . It must incorporate images from the manuscript for reader assistance and include educational content. The scoring system is binary: High Risk or Standard Risk, based on four specific criteria: 1) del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation, 2) High-risk translocations (t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20)) co-occurring with 1q+ and/or del(1p32), 3) Monoallelic del(1p32) with 1q+, or biallelic del(1p32), and 4) High b2M (≥5.5 mg/L) with normal creatinine (<1.2 mg/dL).

Later, the user requested the addition of R-ISS staging by IMWG, with criteria from . Finally, a Creator Credits section was required at the bottom, stating the app is for free educational purposes, including disclaimers, and crediting Ankit Kansagra with a LinkedIn profile link. The user also expressed interest in deploying the application cheaply/for free.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for interactive UI.
- **FastAPI**: Python backend framework for API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data persistence.
- **Tailwind CSS & Radix UI**: For styling and pre-built UI components.
- **Vercel & Railway**: Proposed free hosting platforms for deployment.
- **GitHub**: For version control and project continuation.
- **CRUD Operations**: For managing patient assessment data.
- **Binary Classification**: For IMWG risk assessment logic.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   : The main React application entry point, setting up  for navigation and integrating the main calculator interface. It was initially a simple Hello World and now orchestrates the different calculator sections.
-   : Contains global CSS, including basic React app styling. The AI ensured the main app container is not center-aligned.
-   : Imports Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities, and defines custom CSS variables for color themes (light/dark mode) and base styles.
-   : Configures Tailwind CSS, defining custom colors, border radii, keyframes, and animations based on the design guidelines.
-   : Manages frontend dependencies (React, Radix UI, Axios, etc.) and scripts. Updated to include Vercel build script.
-   : This file was created to house the primary IMWG Risk Prediction calculator logic and UI. It takes inputs for the four risk criteria, performs a binary classification, and displays the result. It underwent significant updates to refine the input forms, incorporate educational content toggles, and display real-time results based on mock data, later integrated with the backend.
-   : Manages the display of survival data. Initially a placeholder, it was updated multiple times to include a , clinical studies evidence, and various survival statistics. Confusing graphical curves were removed by user request, replaced by summary boxes.
-   : Displays reference tables related to IMWG criteria. This was updated to accurately reflect Supplementary Table 4. Current and Potential High-Risk Features for NDMM from the user's provided manuscript, removing any incorrect or made-up data.
-   : A newly created component to implement the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) calculator. It includes inputs for β2-microglobulin, Serum Albumin, FISH analysis, and LDH levels, providing a multi-stage classification (I, II, III).
-   : A newly created component to display creator information and legal disclaimers. It was customized with Dr. Ankit Kansagra's name and LinkedIn profile.
-   : The main FastAPI backend application. It defines API routes (e.g., , ), handles CORS, and connects to MongoDB. It was updated to include patient assessment CRUD operations and a risk calculation engine.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for  and , specifying data structure and validation for MongoDB documents. This was crucial for defining the data schema for storing patient assessments.
-   : A file used to log testing results, which the AI engineer consistently read and updated before and after running backend tests.
-   : Updated to include project description and deployment instructions for Vercel and Railway.
-   Deployment configuration files (, , , , ): These files were created/modified specifically to facilitate deployment on Vercel and Railway platforms.

<pending_tasks>
- Assist the user in saving the current codebase to GitHub.
- Walk the user through the detailed steps for deploying the backend on Railway.

<current_work>
The immediate work being carried out is related to preparing the application for deployment on Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend), fulfilling the user's request for a free hosting solution. The AI engineer has already:
1.  **Created/Updated Deployment Configuration Files**:
    *   : Updated with a project description and high-level deployment guide.
    *   : Created for backend dependencies.
    *   : Created to specify the command for running the FastAPI application on Railway.
    *   : Created for Railway-specific Python dependencies.
    *   : Created to specify the Python runtime version for Railway.
    *   : Created for Vercel-specific frontend deployment configurations.
    *   : Updated to include the necessary build script for Vercel deployment.
2.  **Provided a Detailed Deployment Guide**: A step-by-step guide has been outlined for the user, covering:
    *   Creating a GitHub repository.
    *   Uploading code to GitHub (which the AI is currently assisting with).
    *   Deploying the backend on Railway, including environment variables and MongoDB setup.
    *   Deploying the frontend on Vercel, including environment variables.
    *   Obtaining live URLs after deployment.

The last action performed was showing the user the complete project structure in preparation for saving the code to GitHub. The application is feature-complete with both IMWG Risk Assessment and R-ISS Staging, comprehensive educational content, accurate reference tables, and personalized creator credits. Backend integration is complete and tested.
